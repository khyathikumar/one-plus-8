A short news
None of the OnePlus 8 series will come with a pop-up camera or teardrop notches this time around. We will see the punch-hole prevail, which does mean that if you’re not a fan, then a display cutout might be a dealbreaker for you. The pop-up camera might not have been the best quality, but it really did give you a full-screen experience with absolutely no loss of real estate.

Every single model in the lineup will come with an in-display optical fingerprint reader for biometric security. It’s not yet known if the punch-hole selfie camera will come with any added tech to enhance the native OxygenOS face unlock feature or not yet though.

There are rumors that the OnePlus 8 Pro could finally come with official IP68 water and dust resistance. The fact that the pop-up camera is set to be removed does hint that we might have “proper” resistance for the first time on a OnePlus device. Although with that said, the OnePlus 7 Pro does have a level of water resistance. We don’t yet know if the OnePlus 8 Lite or standard OnePlus 8 will come with water resistance or not yet.

Another addition that has been a long time coming is that of wireless charging. The rumors suggest that only the OnePlus 8 Pro will gain the ability to wirelessly charge — at 30W. It’s disappointing that we might not see all models gain the ability but Warp Charge 30T will still be included.
